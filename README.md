# sorts-in-motion
A lightweight sorting algorithm visualizer that animates how common sorts rearrange an array step by step. It is designed to help learners understand the mechanics of popular algorithms and to help developers quickly recap them with a clear, interactive view.

## Purpose
- Make abstract sorting behavior tangible through animation.
- Provide a quick refresher for common algorithms.
- Offer simple controls for speed, step, and array size to explore behavior.

## What’s Included
- Multiple classic sorting algorithms with live pseudocode.
- Playback controls (play/pause, step, shuffle, reset).
- Adjustable array size and speed.

## Run It
